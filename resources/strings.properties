configIntroTitle=Welcome to Gypsum!
configIntroMessage=<html>Welcome! Before you can use Gypsum for the first time, you'll need to do a small bit of configuration. This will require a webcam, and the blackboard or whiteboard you intend to use, and it will take about five minutes.</html>
configTitle=Gypsum Configuration
configProjectorMessage=<html>Please select which display mode to use. If your projector shows the same image as your computer monitor, select "Mirrored"; otherwise select the appropriate Extended mode depending on whether your projector extends your desktop to the left or right of your main display.</html>
mirroredModeLabel=Mirrored
extendedRModeLabel=Extended (Right)
extendedLModeLabel=Extended (Left)
configImageMessage=<html>Please aim your webcam at the blackboard, and draw a rectangle. Then, adjust the contrast and threshold levels until Gypsum recognizes the rectangle you've drawn.</html>
contrastLabel=Contrast
thresholdLabel=Threshold
calibrationMessage=<html>Gypsum now needs to be calibrated to calculate the relative positions of the camera and the projector. Four squares will be displayed on the board. Please click on the centers of each of the rectangles to draw a quadrilateral.</html>
finishedMessage=<html>Configuration is now complete! If you move the webcam or the projector, Gypsum will need to be re-configured. You can also calibrate the contrast and threshold by selecting "Calibrate" from the Gypsum menu. It is recommended to calibrate prior to each lecture, since lighting conditions can change drastically from day to day.</html>
newLectureMessage=<html>Please select the images you'd like to use for this lecture. There is a limit of six. The order they appear in the list below is the order in which they will be assigned labels. The first image's label is any one-hole shape, the second any two-hole shape, etc.</html>
